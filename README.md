I am a Full Stack and Quality Assurance (QA) Developer, who just completed a Labenu bootcamp, this bootcamp seeks to work in a similar way to the home office work environment, using agile methodologies and group work, making daily use of GitHub And with projects that seek to improve collective and individual performance. I'm currently in a career transition, I'm studying Data and Systems Analysis (ADS) at Wyden and I'm studying Python at the University of Michigan (Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python), I have some projects using apis and automation programs ( Ruby/Selenium/capybara/python).
    I have experience Working in Hospital Pharmacy, I changed Areas Because I didn't see a possibility of evolution in my Life, as I am passionate about Evolution, Technology and Modernity, I visualized in an area that I have been passionate about since I was a child, the possibility of seeking a better future and in a way it's in the area I've always been passionate about, I love teamwork and even more criticism.
    I fell in love with the area doing some automation projects and PokeApi a project that was presented at labenu, it aimed at the use of apis. Github Student(https://github.com/Piedrovi). I hope I can have an opportunity to help a company to develop with my help, thank you in advance for your reading.
